# Rick & Morty Characters Encyclopedia

**This project will be based primarily on your ability to fulfill the task
requirements. Any potential design skills are a bonus, but usability,
performance and security will be taken into account.**

## Introduction
This project provides a starting point which will allow you to create your own
web-based encyclopedia based on the cartoon Rick and Morty.

## Project Requirements
To get started, you'll need the following:

 - PHP
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 - git

 You are free to use whatever PHP packages and front-end libraries that you
 wish.

## Task Requirements
To order to complete this challenge, you MUST create an encyclopedia with minimal
functionality. Your solution MUST allow the user to browse the full list of
Rick and Morty characters in a convenient manner, as well as offer some form of search
functionality. Your solution MUST also display basic information for a specific
character, including:

 - At least one image
 - Name
 - Species
 - Origin
 - Episodes in which they appear

A RESTful API is available at [Rick and Morty]
which will provide you with all the data that you will need. You do not need
to create an account nor authenticate in order to consume the API, however please
be aware that this API is rate-limited.

To get started, we've given you a skeleton folder structure. It is advised
that you spend no more than two to three hours on this assignment.

## Submission
To submit your solution, please fork this repository and provide us a link
to your finished version.
